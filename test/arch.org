* Installing glorious arch linux ☄️

May 2nd, 2019

NOTE: This blog is a /little/ bit outdated. I just went through a new arch
installation in about 2-3 years. Many things were changed, like no more
=wifi-menu=, =rankmirrors=, etc. In general, instructions below would give you
*a* correct installation, but you would just have to fill out some of the gaps
yourself. Good luck 😘

Welcome to my guide on installing Glorious Arch
Linux! For some background, I have been using arch for the last and it
is still my only machine that I use as a daily driver. Arch Linux is a
lightweight DIY type of distro that does not assume what kind of person
you are and thus just lets you be yourself.

** Pre-Installation
The whole system comes with a pre-compiled kernel (=Linux=), package
manager (=pacman=), and some basic coreutils (=GNU=). That does not seem
a lot, but this is just enough to make some great things. It installs a
barebone system which allows the user to customize their system to
smallest details and making it their own. Not like =ubuntu= with all the
whistles and bangs included.

This guide has an exact copy of steps I use when installing Arch Linux.
Installed it over ~25 times. The beauty of arch is that no installation
is considered the best one. Every installation can be unique and
bespoke. This guide only shows how to setup a complete arch environment
with simple and straight-forward steps. If you want to know more about
each step and different options you can go with, please consult with the
official [[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide][Arch Wiki]]. They have everything and more than you will ever need.

Open the [[https://www.archlinux.org/][Arch Linux Official Website]] and
download the latest image file. Later on just take a flash drive and
burn it with =rufus= on Windows or with =dd= on Linux. To save you some
trouble, here is an example =dd= command to burn the image

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% sudo dd if=/path/to/image.iso of=/dev/your_drive
#+END_SRC

NOTE: =%= indicates that we are in the terminal. Everything after =%=
should be executed.

NOTE: This guide does not include installing Arch Linux as dual boot.

** Installation
*** BIOS and Flash Drive
**** BIOS Configuration

This part is quite easy. The only thing that you should do is to tell
your BIOS to boot from Flash Drives instead of bootloader and other
drives. This process is different for every BIOS Version and
motherboard, however, this is really easy as all the entries in the BIOS
menu are self-explanatory.

**** Flash Drive

Just plug in your flash drive and power on/reboot your device. + Now,
you will see a systemd prompt asking to boot. Choose the boot option
that includes Arch Linux in it. + You should see a prompt of this form:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% root@archios
#+END_SRC

IMPORTANT: If you see a bunch of files when running the command below,
then everything is [green]/OK/

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
#+END_SRC

IMPORTANT: If you have an Ethernet connection, you may skip this step.
If you are trying to install Arch Linux on a laptop, please use
=wifi-menu= to connect to a wifi point.

*** Disk Partitioning

Okay, now we need to partition our hard/state drive. How do we do that?
Actually, there are many ways to to it, however I prefer to use
=cfdisk=. It has pseudo-GUI, which is easier to work and operate with.
Before partitioning, we should find the name of your drive. For that, in
your command line type.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% fdisk -l
#+END_SRC

You will see a list of available storages. Ignore everything that ends
with: boot, root, include, etc. What you are interested in is the
biggest available drive. For example, my laptop has integrated SD Card
27GB and it is called =/dev/mmcblk0=. For the sake of simplicity, let's
use notation =/dev/sda= for the name of the drive. Okay, good. Now,
launch =cfdisk= by typing

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% cfdisk -z /dev/sda
#+END_SRC

You will enter pseudo-GUI interface. Select *gpt* and now you will see
your drive's partitions. Next, we need to create 3 partitions:
=EFI System(/dev/sda1)=, =Swap memory(/dev/sda2)= and
=Root Directory (x86\_64)(/dev/sda3)=. I don't create home partitions,
as I just don't like it.

By the rules, your swap should be 2xRAM and EFI System 512MB. Everything
else can be given to Root Directory. Now, exit cfdisk by choosing QUIT.

*** Formatting partitions
We need to format partitions appropriately and accordignly. Your EFI
System should be FAT32 formatted, because we use systemd-boot. To do
that, type

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sda1
#+END_SRC

Your swap partition should be formatted as swap memory (obviously)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% mkswap /dev/sda2
% swapon /dev/sda2
#+END_SRC

Your main directory should be formatted as ext4, so to use all your
files further on

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda3
#+END_SRC

Very good, our partitions are properly formatted and we can go on.

*** Mounting
Now, we should mount our partitions. Firstly, we should mount our root
partition

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% mount /dev/sda3 /mnt
#+END_SRC

Then, we should mount the EFI System, so the system would know where is
the boot point. We also need to create boot directory on our own.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% mkdir /mnt/boot
% mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot
#+END_SRC

Awesome, everything is mounted, now we can start installing the system

*** Finding closest mirrors

This part is quite easy. However, when I was installing my system, I had
a problem with downloading speed, it was something like 20-50KB/s.
Awful. To fix that and get the maximum download speed, do the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup
% sed -i 's/^#Server/Server/' /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup
% rankmirrors -n 6 /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
#+END_SRC

Now, you will be connected to the fastest mirrors in your location.
Hurray!

*** Pacstrap

Now we will install the base system. Here, we will intall base and
base-devel packages, because it will get us enough packages to start
using Arch Linux. It may take a while. Sit back, take a cup of coffee
and relax.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% pacstrap /mnt base base-devel
#+END_SRC

*** Genfstab

Now, the system is installed on the device and we need to tell our OS
and Bootloader about the partitions of our disk. To do so, perform:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
#+END_SRC

CAUTION: Check =/mnt/etc/fstab= for any errors. If it looks right to
you, it probably is.

*** Configuring the system

If you have come this far, congratulations! You have installed the raw
version of arch and essential tools. We have to perform some number of
necessary configurations to make it usable as a daily driver.

Log in to the newly installed system with

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% arch-chroot /mnt
#+END_SRC

WARNING: If it does not let you in or some error occurs, please make
sure you followed all the steps correctly.

**** Setting the time

We need to set your local time. Find your timezone in
=/usr/share/zonenifo= and use it instead of =_Region_= and =_City_=

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime
% hwclock --systohc
#+END_SRC

**** Configuring essential files

- Uncomment =en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8= and other if needed in =/etc/locale.gen=
- Generate locales by running =% locale-gen=
- Set the =LANG= variable equal to locale =% echo 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' > /etc/locale.conf=
- Set the keyboard layout to standard QWERTY =% echo 'KEYMAP=us' > /etc/vconsole.conf=

NOTE: If you are a power user with /dvorak/, run =% echo 'KEYMAP=dvorak' > /etc/vconsole.conf=

- Set the hostname of your choice =% echo _myhostname_ > /etc/hostname=
- Configure the hosts on your machine

=% echo 127.0.0.1 localhost\n::1 localhost\n127.0.1.1 _myhostname_.localdomain _myhostname_ > /etc/hosts= 

- Configuring your network drivers with =% pacman -S iw dialog wpa_actiond wpa_supplicant sudo=
- Generate your kernel image (initramfs) =% mkinitcpio -p linux=
- Change your default root password =% passwd=
- Add new users =% useradd -m -G wheel -s /usr/bin/bash _user_=
- Set the sudo access by uncommenting =%wheel ALL = (ALL) ALL= when running =visudo=
- Changing the /user/'s password =% passwd _user_=

*** Bootloader

Small but important things swept out of the way, we have to configure
one of the most important parts of this installation. Usually only arch
and gentoo people have to work with manually setting up a bootloader.
[[https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_boot_process#Boot_loader][Bootloader]]
is a small program that boots your actual OS after motherboard's BIOS
gives you control over the system. In this installation, we are going
with [[https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/][systemd]]. It is the
most compatible bootloader with Arch system in general. Also, my
laptop's hardware does not work with other bootloaders. Systemd is
getting some bad fame because it is bloated, massive, and way too
complicated. I agree with it but this is the best we have right now.
Just like C++.

NOTE: You can go with [[https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/][GRUB]], but
please consult with Arch Wiki before trying to do that.

Assuming you have an intel chipset, run the following

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
% pacman -S intel-ucode
% bootctl --path=/boot install
#+END_SRC

Use =vi= or =nano= text editor to write down the following:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/boot/loader/loader.conf
------------------------
default Arch(arch)
timeout 4
editor 0
#+END_SRC

And for the second file:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/boot/loader/entries/entry.conf
-------------------------------
title Arch Linux
linux /vmlinuz-linux
initrd /intel-ucode.img
initrd /initramfs-linux.img
options root=/dev/sda3 rw
#+END_SRC

*** Finishing up

You are exactly two commands away from a complete Arch Linux
installation!

You need to exit =chroot= by runing =% exit= and reboot with =% reboot=

When you turn your machine back on, you should see some text popping out
on the screen (that's systemd) and finally, you should see the following
prompt:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
Arch Linux (tty1)
_myhostname_ login:
#+END_SRC

If you see this, then /Congratulations!/ + You have completed the
installation. Everything is terminal based, if you want to install X
Window Server for GUI and other shiny stuff, please follow to teh
Post-Installation chapter.

WARNING: If you did not see the login prompt, retrace your steps and
make sure you followed everything in this guide. Best way to get out, is
just search for the problem online or visit [[https://reddit.com/r/archlinux][r/archlinux]] to get some real
online help.

** Post-Installation

I hope you enjoyed this installation guide. After the last step, you
should be able to have an actual working and stable system. I will not
go into details how to set up your Desktop Environment or Window
Manager. It should be unique and this is your adventure now. I will give
you a list of useful commands just to get started. Also, further reading
links will be included.

- Run this to install a package =% sudo pacman -S _package_name_=
- Remove a package from your system =% sudo pacman -Rs _package_name_=
- Update the system's packages =% sudo pacman -Syu=
- Installing X Graphical Server =% sudo pacman -S xorg xorg-xinit=
- Installing zshell =% sudo pacman -S zsh= and update your shell =% chsh=
- Installing graphical terminal emulator =% sudo pacman -S rxvt-unicode rxvt-unicode-terminfo=
- Installing =i3= and =dmenu= with =% sudo pacman -S i3 dmenu=
- Enable =i3= with =% echo \#!/bin/bash\nexec i3 > ~/.xinitrc= and =% chmod 700 ~/.xinitrc=
- Start graphical X server with =% startx=

IMPORTANT: Never ever run =% sudo pacman --force=. The only exception is
if you have a loaded gun pointed at your head (which is very unlikely,
hopefully).

I hope you enjoyed the installation process and I am sure you were able
to learn something new about Linux and yourself.

/See you next time./
