** This is no life

It doesn't feel right anymore. Every time I write something for my
website, I feel that I have to dance to the tune of =pandoc= and
=asciidoctor=. Maybe the Ruby and Haskell Gods will take pity on me and my stuff
will render as I want them to. Oh... they didn't? Time to write a new =sed= script
to fix that. 

This is no life. Instead of fixing an issue at its root, I've been writing
[[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/legacy-source/sed/html.sed][fixes]], [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/legacy-source/sed/adoc.sed][patches]], and [[https://github.com/thecsw/thecsw.github.io/blob/legacy-source/Makefile][this]]. It was fun in the beginning! Mastering sed and awk,
the forbidden tools echoed from the past. However, as time went on and I wanted
to add more content and get more freedom, [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/web-legacy/][this pipeline]] felt limiting.

** A hero emerges

It is my honor and pleasure to introduce you to [[https://github.com/thecsw/Darkness][Darkness]]! The noblest, static
website generator. The website you are on right now is built by her, with all
the images, styling, embeds, and more! The big advantage of Darkness is that she
is general enough (with a config file), so she can build any website for what
their heart desires.

Darkness currently takes a subset of org-mode files and creates an HTML file for
them. Org-mode is a markup language used by emacs, though it's very similar to
markdown. There is a getting started portion further! It will get you everything
you need to get comfortable with the process. Also, darkness is more agnostic
than just org->html. One just has to write a parser/exporter for a markup
language, enable it, and now we have multiple supported types!

** Plethora of features

Darkness supports a vast array of features and cool tricks, such as

- Project configuration with a [[https://github.com/thecsw/darkness/blob/master/ishmael/darkness.toml][simple toml file]]
- Smart headings (laid out and shifted as needed)
- Paragraphs with full [[https://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html][orgmode-style formatting]]
- Lists with any text and breaking lines
- Intelligent placement of images and their captions
- Orgmode environments, like =quote= and =center=
- Embed support for: youtube, Spotify, video, audio, etc.
- Raw HTML placement and export within the page
- Orgmode interactive tables support
- Stylistic features, like dropcaps
- Native support for image galleries
- Source code blocks with language selection
- Full math render support with [[https://katex.org][KaTeX]]
- Smart Holocene time annotations and layovers
- Rich meta tags with previews enabled on every page
- Creating new darkness websites from a template
- Project cleanup and maintenance tools included with the binary
- Open-source code, PRs, and contributions are welcome!

** Not only noble but also super fast

Darkness is also lightning fast! With the old pipeline, it would take around
15-20 seconds to build my website. Darkness *only takes ~120ms* to do the same,
with IO and memory syscall times included.[fn:: Tested on my macOS 13.0.1 22A400 arm64]
This is why [[https://sandyuraz.com/blogs/pprof/][profiling should be your friend.]] She uses some cool parallelization
tricks, so we spend around 1ms on each page. Pretty cool if you ask me. The
fastest (though admittedly larger) static website generators took a bit more
time in my experience.

** Getting started

Want to try out darkness but don't know org-mode? You are at the very start of
something beautiful, my friend! If you have go 1.18+ installed, run the command
below to get the latest version of her (you can also grab a suitable binary from
the [[https://github.com/thecsw/darkness/releases][releases]] page)

#+begin_src sh
  go install -v github.com/thecsw/darkness@latest
#+end_src

Next, go to the place, where you would like to house your next website. Call her
with a =new= command followed by any name that feeds your soul (=ishmael= is an
example here)

#+begin_src sh
  darkness new ishmael
#+end_src

Voilà! You have a new darkness project initiated. Change into that new directory
with =cd ishmael= and type in =darkness build=. You'll find an =index.html= in the
root, go open it! After that, look into =darkness.toml=, which shows you the
number of things you can play with to change the looks and feel.

Here is [[https://sandyuraz.com/ishmael][Ishmael's website]] that shows the formatting in action with many other
cool things! It's the template website that we just made above. I do hope you
find it fun here

** Niche features

** Why /Darkness/?

Her name is based on one of the characters I love from [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KonoSuba][KonoSuba]]
